# livecoin
LIVE coin, an Ethereuem-based token which remains alive.
The coin is created to prevent idle coins causing damage to the market.

## The idea
The idea behind the **LIVE** coin is that sometimes a large number of tokens are being held by an anonymous person 
(Maybe Satoshi Nakamoto, maybe dead people, maybe lost forever, ...)
So the market will be very sensitive to the movement of that account. 

The live coin will record the last transaction of each address as well as it's balance. The `execute` 
function lets anyone burn any other account after a certain idle time (1 month for example). 
Also, there will be an **execution reward** for the person who executes somebody else.
